   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards:
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code
   - Add type hints to all functions
   - Include docstrings (Google style)
   - Write/update tests as needed

3. Ensure the test suite passes:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Update documentation if needed:

   ```

6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-twin-t1d.git
   cd digital-twin-t1d
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development tools
   ```

4. Install in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Use PEP 8
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for all function arguments and returns
- Docstrings for all public functions/classes (Google style)

### Example:
```python
def predict_glucose(
    history: List[float], 
    horizon_minutes: int = 30
) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """Predicts future glucose levels.
    
    Args:
        history: List of recent glucose values in mg/dL.
        horizon_minutes: Prediction horizon in minutes.
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (predicted_value, confidence_interval).
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

## Testing

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests

### Running Tests:
